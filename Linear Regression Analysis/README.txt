NOTE: 
	(1) The codes generate the plots and save them directly by the names that are hard-coded. These are not displayed separately.
	(2) The codes produce other output on the terminal. Explicit redirection is required to put the information into a file.
	(3) Based on the system, some modules/libraries may have to be installed. The codes use numpy, pandas, itertools and matplotlib

Commands to run the files:

	python ass1_a.py
	python ass1_b.py
	python ass1_c.py
	python ass1_d.py
